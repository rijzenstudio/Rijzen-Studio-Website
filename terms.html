  <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>

  <p>Welcome to Rijzen! Please read these terms carefully before purchasing any of our services.</p>

  <h2>1. Services</h2>
  <p>We offer web design and development services as outlined on our website. Each service tier includes different features, timelines, and maintenance durations.</p>

  <h2>2. Pricing</h2>
  <p>The pricing listed on the site includes the service fee only. <strong>Domain and hosting charges are not included</strong> and must be arranged or paid separately by the client unless specified otherwise in writing.</p>

  <h2>3. Payment</h2>
  <p>Full payment or a mutually agreed advance is required to begin the project. Final delivery will occur after the remaining balance is settled.</p>

  <h2>4. Revisions</h2>
  <p>Each package includes a specified number of revisions. Additional revisions may incur extra charges.</p>

  <h2>5. Delivery Timeline</h2>
  <p>Timelines are estimated based on prompt client communication. Delays in content or feedback may extend delivery.</p>

  <h2>6. Ownership</h2>
  <p>Once full payment is made, ownership of the project files is transferred to the client. We may still showcase the project in our portfolio unless the client requests otherwise.</p>

  <h2>7. Cancellation</h2>
  <p>In case of cancellation by the client after work has started, the advance payment will not be refunded.</p>
