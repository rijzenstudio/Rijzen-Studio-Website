  <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>

  <p>These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern the engagement between Rijzen ("Service Provider") and the Client ("Client") for the provision of web-related services. By accessing or using our services, the Client agrees to abide by these Terms in full.</p>

  <h2>1. Scope of Services</h2>
  <p>Rijzen shall provide website design, development, and related digital services as agreed upon and outlined in the chosen service package. Services not explicitly mentioned in the selected package are excluded and will require separate agreements and additional fees.</p>

  <h2>2. Pricing and Exclusions</h2>
  <p>All pricing mentioned on the website or proposal documents pertains solely to the design and development services. <strong>Domain name registration and web hosting costs are not included</strong> in the standard service packages and must be arranged separately by the Client unless explicitly stated otherwise.</p>

  <h2>3. Payment Terms</h2>
  <p>Project commencement is subject to receipt of an advance payment, typically 50% of the total agreed fee unless otherwise agreed. The balance must be settled prior to final delivery. Rijzen reserves the right to suspend progress or withhold deliverables until full payment is received.</p>

  <h2>4. Revisions</h2>
  <p>Each service tier includes a fixed number of revisions as documented. Requests beyond the included revisions will be billed separately. Unused revision rounds do not carry over or reduce the total project cost.</p>

  <h2>5. Project Timeline</h2>
  <p>Estimated timelines are provided as a guideline. The Client agrees to provide necessary materials, content, and feedback in a timely manner. Delays in communication or input from the Client may extend delivery deadlines.</p>

  <h2>6. Ownership and Usage Rights</h2>
  <p>All intellectual property in the final deliverables becomes the Client’s property only after full payment is made. Rijzen retains the right to use completed work in its portfolio and marketing materials unless expressly prohibited in writing.</p>

  <h2>7. Confidentiality</h2>
  <p>Rijzen agrees not to disclose or misuse any confidential information shared by the Client for the purpose of completing the project. Likewise, the Client agrees not to share project code or deliverables with third parties without proper attribution or agreement.</p>

  <h2>8. Refund and Cancellation Policy</h2>
  <p>All advance payments are non-refundable. If the Client cancels the project after work has commenced, Rijzen is entitled to retain the payment made thus far. Refunds will not be processed for dissatisfaction based on subjective preferences after delivery, unless agreed in advance.</p>

  <h2>9. Post-Delivery Support & Maintenance</h2>
  <p>Free maintenance is provided for a limited duration as outlined in each package (e.g., 1–6 months). Support or updates requested beyond the included period will incur additional charges based on current rates.</p>

  <h2>10. Liability Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>Rijzen is not responsible for any direct, indirect, or consequential damages resulting from the use of its services. This includes, but is not limited to, loss of data, business interruption, or technical issues arising from third-party hosting platforms or domain registrars.</p>

  <h2>11. Force Majeure</h2>
  <p>Rijzen shall not be liable for failure or delay in performance due to events beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to natural disasters, cyberattacks, power outages, or government restrictions.</p>

  <h2>12. Modifications</h2>
  <p>Rijzen reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time without prior notice. Continued use of our services following any such changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.</p>

  <h2>13. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
  <p>These Terms shall be governed by the laws of India. Any disputes arising shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Ernakulam, Kerala.</p>

  <h2>14. Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>For details on how user data is collected, used, and protected, please refer to our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
